**US Stock Market Prediction Models**
=====================================

**Overview**
------------

This repository contains a collection of machine learning models designed to predict the US stock market. The models are trained on historical stock data and can be used to forecast future market trends.

**Models**
----------

The repository currently includes the following models:

* [Insert model names, e.g. LSTM, Random Forest, etc.]
